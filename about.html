                Hello, My name is Ondrej Zubek and I would like to introduce myself to you.
                I'm a freelance web applications developer from Slovakia. I have been working in this field for over 3 years now.
                I have a passion for creating visually appealing and responsive web apps.
                I started when I was in 7th grade in middle school, I was about to turn 13 years old. I remember that I wanted to start earning some money, so I search some options.
                I was always a type of a child that liked to be on phone or tablet so I wanted to do something on computer, I was founding some interesting ways to earn money as a 13 year old kid but I didn't found somethinh that would be fun for me to do.
                And after few I foung a type of work that I would like to do for more than 1 year. So I learned my first programing languages i was HTML&CSS.
                I build my first website but it was trash I was ashamed to put it on google so I deleted it. After a few tries I build something good, I was so happy about it so I try so sell it.
                No one wanted to buy my website but after few months someone call me. It was someone that is about to carry my life for 3 more years his name is Stano Kucharik.
                He worked for one of the biggest companies in Slovakia. He tells me that he want to buy my website for a couple hundret euros. Stano gave me an opportunity to work for company that he worked for, but I refuse.
                I started to learn some new programing languages I think I started with TypeScript and right after that I learned JavaScript programming.
