       <section class="about">

           <p class="about-me">
            Hello, my name is Ondrej Zubek, and I would like to introduce myself to you. I'm a freelance web and application developer from Slovakia. I have been working in this field for over three years now, and I have a passion for creating visually appealing and responsive web applications.
           </p>
       
         <p class="about-me">
            I started when I was in 7th grade in middle school, just about to turn 13 years old. I remember wanting to start earning some money, so I searched for options. I was always the type of child who liked to be on my phone or tablet, so I wanted to do something on the computer. I found several interesting ways to earn money as a 13-year-old, but I didnâ€™t find anything that I would enjoy doing. After a few days, I discovered a type of work that I would like to pursue for more than a year. So, I learned my first programming languages, which were HTML and CSS. I built my first website, but it was not good. I was ashamed to put it on Google, so I deleted it.
              </p>
           
                <p class="about-me">
                    After a few attempts, I created something better. I was so happy about it that I tried to sell it. However, no one wanted to buy my website. But after a few months, someone called me. It was a person who would change my life for the next three years: his name is Stano Kucharik. He worked for one of the biggest companies in Slovakia. He told me that he wanted to buy my website for a couple of hundred euros. Stano offered me an opportunity to work for the company he was with, but I declined. I then started to learn new programming languages; I believe I began with TypeScript, and shortly after that, I learned JavaScript.
